# StockUp Application

Tasks: (do 3 in total):

1. **Calculate the net worth of the portfolio (REQUIRED!)**
2. **Sell a stock from your portfolio (balance and net worth should update)**
3. **Stock swap: Exchange 1 stock for another (tricky! any leftover funds should be added to the balance)**
4. **Fix/improve all PRINT statements! (with color as well, research)**
